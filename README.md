# resty
Connect RESTy with APIs, running live requests


# Phase 2 Requirements
In phase 2, we will be connecting RESTy to live APIs, 
fetching and displaying remote data. 
Our primary focus will be to service GET requests

## The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.


# options

- As a user, I want to enter the URL to an API and issue a 
GET request so that I can retrieve it’s data
- As a user, I want to see the results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format

# Application Flow:

User enters an API URL
Chooses a REST Method
Clicks the “API” button
Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified
Displays the response headers and results separately
Both headers and results should be “pretty printed” JSON
